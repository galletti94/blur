# blur

blur is an Android App that uses your camera to recognize digits and letters (hopefully even those that are difficult to read because of poor eyesight or bad handwriting) and will learn from experience by storing photos in a database.

## What it looks like

Selecting digits, we can point the camera and capture a picture of the digit we want to recognize.

The app processes the image to be ready for prediction. We can check if the digit is well captured and processed and either try again or make a prediction

Pressing CORRECT sends to the database and returns to main screen, INCORRECT gives the option to improve our model by submitting feedback.

The following is the feedback screen. The user can choose whether or not to send the feedback.
