# blur

blur is an Android App that uses your camera to recognize digits and letters (hopefully even those that are difficult to read because of poor eyesight or bad handwriting) and will learn from experience by storing photos in a database.

## What it looks like

Selecting digits, we can point the camera and capture a picture of the digit we want to recognize.

We can then check if the digit is well captured and either try again or make a prediction

Predicting gives a good result! Pressing OK sends to the database, CANCEL just returns to the camera view.

If the prediction were incorrect and somehow the user figured out what the digit was, the user can input this information and send the labeled image to the database.
